# Elanif Software Requirements

Elanif is the working title of a music notation software.  This repository contains planning documents for the software.

If you are interested in helping with the project, consider the following:
1) Suppor Chris Roode on patreon.  He's spearheading this project!  https://www.patreon.com/chrisroode  Chris will put as much time as he can into the project, but he's also gotta pay rent.
2) If you have coding skills, I am currently planning the project and creating requirements.  Familiarize yourself with the documents in this repository.  Be sure to find the coding standard and get an idea of what patterns we will be using.  When the coding starts, it'll move fast.
3) If you want to share your linguisic talents (writing documentation and translations), stay tuned.  We'll have a lot of needs for that, and that is honestly where TONS of help from non-programmers will be needed.
